# Credit-scoring-model-
This project uses machine learning to predict whether an applicant is creditworthy or high-risk based on financial features like income, credit score, and loan amount. A RandomForestClassifier is used, with data preprocessed via scaling and encoding. The model evaluates using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
